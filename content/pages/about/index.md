Hello ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am a failed engineer turned copywriter who loves and understands tech products and platforms. I have a knack for storytelling and love writing longform content too.

Basically, I love everything to do with written words. I have 6 years of professional experience in writing but Iâ€™ve been playing with words ever since I was a kid. (Now you know why I quit engineering!)

I have been working at EMBIBE, an AI-powered learning platform that personalises education for every learner, for the past 6 years. At EMBIBE, I have worked as a Content Writer/Editor, Copy Writer and UX Writer for the Content Marketing, Employer Branding, Customer Support, Brand Marketing, Public Relations and UX teams. This has given me a holistic understanding of how marketing works and I have experience in writing for a wide range of marketing collaterals. In a nutshell, I have the experience of building a brand.

Currently, I am working as a UX Writer at EMBIBE. UX gives me the opportunity to write for technology and lend technology a voice as good as the humans building it.

In my spare time, I roam around the city and take pictures, or make cartoons. I love coding, playing chess and painting.
